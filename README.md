> [!NOTE]
> âš¡ Eletronics are dangerous<br>
> ðŸ¤“ Tinkering with your smart desk might void your warranty. Proceed with caution. I tested it with one specific desk and one MCU series.

I got inspired by [Adrian's ESPHome touch display mount](https://github.com/akuehlewind/ESPHome-touch-display-mount) and [Mick's LoctekMotion IoT project](https://github.com/iMicknl/LoctekMotion_IoT), so thanks for this opportunity!  
Basically, I first found the [printable screen mount on Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/de/models/799188-desk-mount-for-touch-display-esp32-2432s028) and then started tinkering around my Flexispot-Desk. 

I got a **Flexispot E7Q**, also sold as **Odin/E7Q Pro** in the English-speaking market:  
- [Flexispot Odin (EN)](https://www.flexispot.com/flexispot-odin-4-leg-standing-desk)  
- [Flexispot E7Q (DE)](https://www.flexispot.de/elektrisch-hohenverstellbares-tischgestell-e7q.html)
- It is using a HS13B-1 controller, pinout similar to the HS01BB-1

## Learnings  
- If the table/controller does not respond, try **unplugging the RJ45 connectors** to your display(s), whether it's an ESP32 or the original Loctek MCU which is probably STMicroelectronics-based.
- **Different versions of the "cheap yellow display"** â€“ Mine has two USB inputs (USB-C and Micro-USB). The mounting holes were slightly off, so I used a 4/6mm drill to fix it (carefully).
- **Set limits for the desk** - Or the table will crash or interfere with obstacles.  
- **Disable the hardware UART** or at least the console on the ESP32.  
- Not all pins are needed for this project. At least the **ðŸŸ£purple, âšªwhite, and ðŸŸ¤brown wires** from the original cable are not required (**SWIM and Reset** are probably needed to program the controller in the factory).
- If you're unsure about the pinout, open the original controller and write down the cable colors and its function. I can also recommend [the archive page](https://github.com/iMicknl/LoctekMotion_IoT/blob/main/archive/esphome/README.md) on the LoctekMotion_IoT-Prject or a simple [google search](https://github.com/iMicknl/LoctekMotion_IoT/issues/12) to find the correct pins.
- The inbuilt display graphics from ESPHome are quite slow, so if you're having live values on the screen, then it is probably too slow. The new YAML for ESPHome features LVGL

## Required Parts
You might need some physical and virtual tools, such as: a screwdriver, 3d-printer, [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) installed within [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and some technical knowledge (not really programming, but you should be able to read those YAML files etc)

# Pinout and assignment
The following picture and the tables showing the pin usages/assignments, cable colors for the **RJ45-wiring**

## RJ45 Pinout Table / HS13B-1
This table shows the RJ45 pin assignments with the corresponding wire colors for **LoctekMotion HS13B-1** and **Ethernet T568B** wiring standards. 

| RJ45 Pin | Name   | HS13B-1 Color | Ethernet / T568B Color |
|----------|--------|--------------|-----------------------|
| 8        | **+5V / VDD** | ðŸŸ¡ Yellow  | ðŸŸ¤ Brown            |
| 7        | **GND**    | ðŸ”µ Blue      | âšªðŸŸ¤ White-Brown     |
| 6        | **TX**     | âš« Black     | ðŸŸ¢ Green             |
| 5        | **RX**     | ðŸŸ¢ Green     | âšªðŸ”µ White-Blue      |
| 4        | **PIN 20** | ðŸ”´ Red       | ðŸ”µ Blue             |
| 3        | N/A    | ðŸŸ£ Purple    | âšªðŸŸ¢ White-Green     |
| 2        | SWIM   | âšª White     | ðŸŸ  Orange           |
| 1        | RESET  | ðŸŸ¤ Brown     | âšªðŸŸ  White-Orange    |

**Example:** Yellow cable/Pin 8 is used for +5V voltage on the Loctek RJ45, it will be Brown on a standard ethernet cable. ðŸŸ¡->ðŸŸ¤

## ESP32-2432S028 Pinout
Here is an overview of the ESP-Pinout. Unfortunately, some Pins have multiple functions, preconfigured pullups, so i used the hardware UART and IO22. The Pin headers are 2/4 pin JST headers, 1.25mm pitch

## P5/Serial port connection
The following table shows the pin assignments for the **P5** connector. **All four pins are required**, used for power and data.

| Pin | Function  | Color (JST) | Color (T568B) |
|-----|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1   | **Vin (5V)**  | ðŸ”´ Red      | ðŸŸ¤ Brown      |
| 2   | **TXD**       | âš« Black    | ðŸŸ¢ Green      |
| 3   | **RXD**       | ðŸŸ¡ Yellow   | âšªðŸ”µ White-Blue |
| 4   | **GND**       | ðŸŸ¢ Green    | âšªðŸŸ¤ White-Brown |

## CN1/IO2 Pinout
The following table shows the pin assignments for the **CN1** connector. Only **IO22** is required, GND is optional, already satisfied by the first connector.

| Pin | Function     | Color (JST) | Color (T568B) |
|-----|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1   | 3V3        | âš« Black    |               |
| 2   | **IO22 / PIN20** | ðŸ”µ Blue     | ðŸ”µ Blue       |
| 3   | IO27 (Pullup 10k 3V3) | ðŸŸ¡ Yellow   |               |
| 4   | GND        | ðŸ”´ Red      | âšªðŸŸ¤ White-Brown |

**Legend:**  
- âšªðŸŸ  = White in combination with the second color of the twisted pair e.g. âšªðŸŸ  = White-Orange, ðŸŸ  = Orange
- Ethernet colors are based on the **T568B** standard, if using **T568A**, the connectors use other colors
- **Bold** means this pin or function is mandatory
- JST (P5/CN1) wire colors might differ, please check it carefully.

# Software
I decided to hop on that train and use ESPHome (quite new for me). I will provide two YAMLs for which can easily installed from the Home Assistant GUI/ESPHome Addon.

## flexispot-e7q-esp32-2432s028-default_graphics
This one is basically a fork of [ESPHome-touch-display-mount](https://github.com/akuehlewind/ESPHome-touch-display-mount) but instead of using other HA components, i enabled it to control the LoctekMotion/Flexispot Desk.<br>
The UI is nice, but there are some considerations:
- In case the display is updated, that will take some time, so to get rid of that I decided to show no live values when manually lowering or rising the desk.
- 8 Bit color only, in the current (02/2025) ESPHome release there is a bug, so there's [a workaroud](https://github.com/akuehlewind/ESPHome-touch-display-mount/issues/4)
- Loads of YAML and lambdas, the UI is in German at that time, so if you're into translating it, you should probably adjust the weekdays. BTW: HÃ¶he means height in German
- Only two presets are used: Preset 1 and 2, I did not use the "sit" and "stand" preset
- Buttons are deactivated in yaml, but no visual feedback for the user
- HA Time Sync replaced with NTP, but you can change that at any time
- Glyphs (for the symbols) and Letters adjusted, used anchors in the yaml

Here you will find [flexispot-e7q-esp32-2432s028-default_graphics.yaml](YAML/flexispot-e7q-esp32-2432s028-default_graphics.yaml)

## flexispot-e7q-esp32-2432s028-lvgl
Still there are many parts from [ESPHome-touch-display-mount](https://github.com/akuehlewind/ESPHome-touch-display-mount) and the [LoctekMotion IoT project](https://github.com/iMicknl/LoctekMotion_IoT) there is LVGL to control the display, buttons and its UI
<br>Some special things about this one:
- There is a bootlogo, thats not necessary at all
- The bar-graph at the bottom indicated the current height. The min/max values are used from the yaml, even if its below or above that (those desks tend to overshoot a little)
- Less lambdas for the buttons, but still: Buttons are deactivated if certain heights are below or above a treshold
- The UI is less appealing than the first version, but its more flexible and faster (live height-data during movement)
- Its still WIP, so please take some time to validate which one you would like to use

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> flexispot-e7q-esp32-2432s028-lvgl.yaml will be added soon
